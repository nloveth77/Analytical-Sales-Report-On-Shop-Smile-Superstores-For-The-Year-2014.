The major aim and objective for this analysis is to analyze the sales report of Shop & Smile Superstores for the year 2014, and this analysis further aims at helping the stakeholders of this project to make data-driven decisions for the business in the next coming year.

Methodology:     
The major dataset used for this analysis is Sales Data. The key methodology used is Microsoft Excel and the Pivot table in Microsoft  Excel was the major tool used to address and answer all of the project questions.

Story of Data:
This project is connected to a sales dataset from the Grocery industry and available for public consumption. The dataset was downloaded from kaggle.com and it has a total number of 370 rows and 26 columns.

The dataset is structured in columns and rows. The columns contain variables, both Dependent and Independent Variables. And the rows contain the data points and transactions.
The analysis includes Revenue as the key outcome variable and variables such as Customer Name, Region, Category, City, Salesperson, Quantity and State. These variables contribute immensely to this analysis as they are key factors to addressing and answering questions from the project.
The limitations and biases encountered with the dataset were empty columns, duplicates, inconsistency in letter casing and word spacing.

 Data Splitting and Preprocessing: 

Data cleaning;
I got the dataset downloaded from kaggle.com and uploaded it into my Excel Workbook for further  analysis. Basic checks and observations were made in the dataset to ensure it was clean and consistent for analysis. Checks for duplicates, empty cells, inconsistencies in letter casing and spacing were made and corrected.  To retain the raw dataset for another use, I had to duplicate the dataset and use one for the analysis.

-Post-Analysis Observations and Recommendation:

-Observations;

1. Nancy Freehafer topped other salespersons. She’s from the Northern Region, and her top customers are Company H, Company A and Company G. The products she sold more were beverages, sauces, dairy products, canned meat, candy and baked goods. She also made great sales in June, October and December.

2. Jan Kotas generated the least revenue among other salespersons. He’s from the Eastern region, Company CC is his only customer. His highest sales were in June and December. Denver ship city was his best ship city and the products he sold more were beverages, fruits & Veg., and candy.

3. The Southern region recorded huge sales and revenue in the months of June, October, November and December. The ship cities that worked more with the Southern region in 2014 are Miami and Memphis. Company BB, Company Z and Company K patronized the Southern region massively and the major products they bought were beverages, canned meat, sauces, oil, soups, dried fruit and nuts, within the transaction counts of 0–1,000, 1,000 -2,000, 2,000–3,000, 3,000–4,000. Anne Larson was outstanding and much preferred by the Southern region customers.

4. The Eastern region also recorded amazing sales and revenue in the months of January, June and December. products within the transaction counts of 0–1,000, 1,000–2,000, 2,000–3,000 and 3,000–4,000 were purchased more by Company I, Company C, Company CC, Company L and Company AA. Mariyah Sergienko, Robert Zare, and Jan Kotas are the salespersons in the Eastern region and the products they sold more are beverages, dairy products, sauces, pasta, fruit & Veg. and soups. Mariyah Sergienko is the top salesperson in this region with a generated revenue of $42,370.88.

5. Products like sauces were only sold in March, May, July, and October. The major regions that purchased this category are the Northern, Southern, and Western regions. Company H, Company K, Company F, and Company C are the main customers and buyers of this product. Nancy Freehafer, Mariyah Sergienko, Ann Larson, and Michael Neifer are the highest salespersons for this product.

6. Syrups like condiments were sold more in February, May, July, September, and December. This product sold well in the Western region and only condiments within the amounts of 0 -1,000 were sold. Mariyah Sergienko is the best salesperson from this product and his major customer was Company C.

7. Company A patronized the Northern region more in the months of May, September, and December. And the products they purchased more within the amounts of 0–1,000, 1,000–2,000, 3,000–4,000 were beverages and canned meat. Nancy Freehafer has a good business relationship with them, which made her company’s A most preferred salesperson.

8. The best customer for the Southern region is Company K and they purchased more sauces, beverages, dried fruits and nuts in the months of February, March, July and November. They preferred Miami as their ship city and Anne Larson as their best salesperson.

-Recommendation;

1. I recommend that Nancy Freehafer should be promoted. More of the products she sold should be made readily available always in the months of June, October, and December. The strategies she uses for her services should be studied and adopted by other salespersons in the Northern region and even in the other regions.

2. Because Jan Kotas is the lowest salesperson in all the regions and as well the least performing salesperson in the Eastern region, he can be transferred to the Northern region to work under Nancy Freehafer and learn the business/sales ethics from her.

3. The Southern region should make sure to have a large quantity of beverages, canned meat, sauces, oil, soups, dried fruits and nuts in the months of June, October, November. and December as their customers purchase more of these goods within this period. Anne Larson can also be appreciated for encouraging her to do more and better in this region.

4. The Eastern region should make sure to provide larger quantities of products like beverages , dairy products, sauces, pasta, fruit & veg., and soups within the amount categories of 0–1,000, 1,000–2,000, 2,000–3,000, 3,000–4,000 in the months of January, June, and December.

5. Since both the Northern, Southern and Eastern regions bought the product category ‘sauce’ a lot in the months of March, May, July, and September. I recommend that sauce shouldn’t be found wanting in these regions. Salespersons like Nancy Freehafer, Anne Larson, Mariyah Sergienko and Michael Neifer should be put in-charge of this product category, since they’ve been known by customers as the best salespersons for this product.

6. The product category ‘Syrups’ sells more and only in the Eastern region in the months of February, May, July, September, and December. A study or observation should be carried out to ascertain why other regions don’t purchase this particular product, and needed measures taken to make the product category sell more in the other regions.

7. Find out why Company A is the only customer that patronizes the Northern region in the months of May, September, and December and arrange a competition or promo plan for the other companies within the Northern region to make them improve their patronages.

8. Find out why Company K, which is the best customer in the Southern region buys only sauces, beverages, dried fruits & nuts and then orient Ann Larson their preferred salesperson on how to convince them( Company K ) to buy other products from the store.
